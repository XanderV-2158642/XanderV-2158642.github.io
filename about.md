A little information about me:

I am a master student computer science at UHasselt. My main interests are in the field of Human Computer interaction, mainly computational fabrication. Next to that I also do a lot of stuff around networking and am very interested in parallel processing and distibuted systems.

Next to programming I like to make stuff, and 3D print a lot. I also play guitar, and make my own guitar pedals.
